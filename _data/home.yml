      - Python is the language I use most at work and enjoy using at home. I have a lot of experience using packages like <a href='https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/'>Flask</a> and <a href='https://www.sqlalchemy.org/'>SQLAlchemy</a> for building web-based solutions.
      - I really enjoy using the language and find it useful outside of work for webscraping, solving <a href='#'>Euler Project</a> problems, or other ideas I have.
